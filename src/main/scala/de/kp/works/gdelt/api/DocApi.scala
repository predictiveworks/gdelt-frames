     * images and which are novel images that have never been found anywhere on the web before by 
     * Google's crawlers.
     * 
     * (You can also use the "imagewebcount" query term above to restrict your search to just images 
     * which have appeared a certain number of times.) Only a relatively small percent of news images 
     * contain an embedded capture datestamp that documents the date and time the image was taken or 
     * created and it is not always accurate, but where available this can offer a powerful indicator
     * that a given image may be older than it appears and for applications that rely on filtering 
     * for only novel images (such as crisis mapping image cataloging), this can be used as a signal 
     * to perform further verification on an image.

     * (Though typically the actual range will be from -20 to 20 or less). Articles in the -1 to +1 bin tend 
     * to be more neutral or factually-focused, while those on either extreme tend to be emotionally-laden 
     * diatribes.

     * means that most coverage clustered around -7 or whether it means there were a lot of extremely negative 
     * and extremely positive coverage that averaged out to -7, but no actual coverage around that tonal range.
