     * reverse Google Images search), 
     * 
     * 2) a list of up to 6 of those web pages elsewhere on the web where the image was 
     * found in the past, 
     * 
     * 3) the date the photograph was captured via in the image's internal metadata (EXIF/etc), 
     * and 
     * 
     * 4) a warning if the image's embedded date metadata suggests the photograph was taken 
     * more than 72 hours prior to it appearing in the given article. 
     * 
     * Using this information you can rapidly triage which of the returned images are heavily-used 
     * images and which are novel images that have never been found anywhere on the web before by 
     * Google's crawlers.
     * 
     * (You can also use the "imagewebcount" query term above to restrict your search to just images 
     * which have appeared a certain number of times.) Only a relatively small percent of news images 
     * contain an embedded capture datestamp that documents the date and time the image was taken or 
     * created and it is not always accurate, but where available this can offer a powerful indicator
     * that a given image may be older than it appears and for applications that rely on filtering 
     * for only novel images (such as crisis mapping image cataloging), this can be used as a signal 
     * to perform further verification on an image.

     * shown as its image when shared via social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. 
     *

     * globally varies so much through the course of a day and through the weekend and holiday periods,

     *  articles by the total number of all articles monitored by GDELT in each time step.

     *  Thus, the timeline reports volume as a percentage of all global coverage monitored by GDELT.

     *  maximum temporal resolution, while for time spans from 72 hours to one week it uses an hourly

     * This is an extremely powerful visualization that creates an emotional histogram showing the tonal

     * is tallied up and binned by tone, from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). 
     * 
     * (Though typically the actual range will be from -20 to 20 or less). Articles in the -1 to +1 bin tend 
     * to be more neutral or factually-focused, while those on either extreme tend to be emotionally-laden 
     * diatribes. 
     * 
     * Typically most sentiment dashboards display a single number representing the average of all coverage 
     * matching the query ala "The average tone of Donald Trump coverage in the last week is -7". Such displays
     * are not very informative since its unclear what precisely "-7" means in terms of tone and whether that 
     * means that most coverage clustered around -7 or whether it means there were a lot of extremely negative 
     * and extremely positive coverage that averaged out to -7, but no actual coverage around that tonal range. 
     * 
     * By displaying tone as a histogram you are able to see the full distributional curve, including whether 
     * most coverage clusters around a particular range, whether it has an exponential or bell curve, etc.
